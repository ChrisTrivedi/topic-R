# TOPIC: R
A repository for the lessons and tutorials for the R TOPIC channel of the [BVCN](https://biovcnet.github.io/).   
Each week we will debut a new lesson with a video tutorial and a set time for a live demonstration. Additionally, we will work to hold **R Office** hours each week to review the material, go into more detail on what we've learned, and try to answer any questions you may have.


## Prerequisites
* Access to browser window, RStudio Cloud account
* (_Optional_)[Experience with the command line](https://github.com/biovcnet/biovcnet.github.io/wiki/2.-Using-the-Command-line)

# Overview
This BVCN topic will cover:

* the fundamentals of coding in the R language
* methods for importing data to R and data wrangling
* methods for data analysis
* troubleshooting your own R code
* how to generate graphs or figures in R
* the use of R in the context of analyzing commonly encountered data types (e.g., amplicon sequence results, differential expression, etc.)


# Lesson 1
### Title: Introduction to R & Connect to RStudio Cloud

Goals:
* Introduce the R language
* [Connect to RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud)
* Copy and move your first R lesson to your RStudio Cloud workspace
* Learn basic operators and R syntax   

**Lesson 1 agenda**
1. Sign up with a free [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) account
2. Find the provided link from Slack or the introduction email to grant you access to the BVCN R lesson workspace in RStudio.
3. Watch this tutorial intro to RStudio and how we will navigate lessons [Link to YouTube video]()
4. Work through basic functions in the *Lesson01* R project

**Orientation in RStudio Cloud**
* _Workspaces_: This is your own personal workspace or “sandbox”. You can make them private or public. The BVCN lessons will be listed each week in the BVCN-R workspace.
* _Projects_: This is a list of R Projects that you can open in RStudio Cloud. Each week, you can copy the lessons from the shared BCVN Workspace to your personal list of projects
* To execute a command from an R script (which will be sent to the Rconsole), on a **Mac**: press COMMAND+ENTER and on a **PC** it is CTRL+ENTER

**What is RStudio Cloud?**
RStudio itself is also an application that can be installed on your computer that is an easy to use interface for writing and executing R code. RStudio Cloud is a cloud-based platform to run RStudio. It circumvents the installation of R on your local computer, to minimize any issues and frustrations that may arise when learning and accessing R remotely. Another reason we are using Rstudio Cloud is that it will be a streamlined way for us to share code with you as we venture into learning the R language.
